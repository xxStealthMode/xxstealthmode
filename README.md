### About

I run <b>Kashimoto Network</b>, a long-running Minecraft Bedrock world plus the bots, services, and web infrastructure that keep it alive.  
I care about code that survives updates, real players using it, and systems that can be extended instead of rewritten every six months.

### What I’m building

- **Kashimoto Network** – persistent Bedrock world, custom systems, and supporting web stack  
- Discord bots – status, moderation, and game integration for Minecraft and FiveM  
- Internal tools – small utilities that automate boring server admin work

---

### How I work

- Ship small, improve constantly, and keep production stable  
- Prefer boring tech that runs for years over flashy stacks that burn out in months  
- Design for “someone has to maintain this later,” even if that someone is just me
